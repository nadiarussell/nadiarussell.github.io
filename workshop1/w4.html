      "Codes essentially create a shorthand so that tasks can be executed
      repeatedly without giving instructions manually each time. Codes of 
      action function similarly: once a code of action or a code of conduct
      is established, there is less of a choice to be made when one arrives
      at a crossroads: the code tells one how to proceed, much the way 
      <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>
      code does with <code>if/else</code> statements."
